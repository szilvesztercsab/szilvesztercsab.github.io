# Welcome

This is the **personal** website of a developer so don't expect much content.

It's also an exploration/experimentation of [GitHub Pages with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

**For your daily internet fix and to find out more visit...** some other website.
